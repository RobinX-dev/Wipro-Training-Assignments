1. Write the Pseudocode to Calculate the sum of digits of the number given by user
Eg: 456=4+5+6=15


Algorithm

1. Declare a variable called num
2. And get the value for variable num
3. Declare another variable called result and set value to 0
4. While loop until num is less than or equal to 0
	Declare variable to store Remaninder called rem
	seperate the last digit from the number using %10 (modulus) operator.
	Add remainder to result variable.
	Then Remove the last digit from the number using /10
5. Display the result.

Pseudocode

1.Start
2.Declare int num = 456
3.Declare result = 0
4.while(num is greater than 0)
	Declare int rem = num%10
	Add result = result+rem
	remove last digit num = num/10
5.print result
6.Stop
