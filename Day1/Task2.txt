2. Write the Pseudocode to calcualte the area of a rectangle, square and circle


Algorithm

1.Declare the variable called Shape and the shape from user
2.Check if shape is Rectangle
	Declare length and width and get the value from the user
	declare Area and store the area of the rectangle
	Print Area
3.Check if shape is "Square"
	Declare variable called Side and get it from the user
	Declare variablle called Area and stored the area of the square
	print Area
4.Check if shape is "Circle"
	Declare variable called radius and get value from user
	Declare variablle called Area and stored the area of the Circle
	print Area


Pseudocode

1.start
2.Declare string shape;
3.if shape == "Rectangle"
	Declare int length, Width;
	Declare int Area = length*Width
	Print Area
4.if shape == "Square"
	Declare int Side
	Declare int Area = Side*Side
	Print Area
5.if shape == "Circle"
	Declare int radius
	Declare int Area = 3.14*radius*radius
	Print Area
6.Stop
