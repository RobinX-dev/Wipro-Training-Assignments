3. Write the Pseudocode to calculate the average of 5 marks accepted from user. If the average is between 75-90 print excellent, 
60-75 print good and 45-60 pass below 45 fail


Algorithm


1.Declare variables Mark1,Mark2,Mark3,Mark4,Mark5 and the values of earch marks
2.Declare Average to store the average of 5 marks.
3.Add all the marks and divide it by 5 to get the average
4.if average is 65 to 75 print good
5.or average is 45 to 65 print pass
6 or average is below 45 print fail


Pseudocode

1.Declare int Mark1,Mark2,Mark3,Mark4,Mark5
2.Declare int Average
3.Average = (Mark1+Mark2+Mark3+Mark4+Mark5)/5
4.if Average> 65 and Average<75
	print "Good"
5.Else if Average>45 and Average<65
	print "Pass"
6.Else if Average<45
	print "Fail"
